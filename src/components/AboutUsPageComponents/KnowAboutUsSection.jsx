            Sri Matha Trust was started in the year 2000, with the holy
            blessings of Kanchi Seer Shri. Jayendra Swamighal and he also
            suggested the name. Mr. V. Krishnamoorthy is the Managing Trustee of
            Sri Matha Trust. Many decades ago, he had lost his mother to cancer.
            Massive medical bills ravaged his finances and left such a deep
            imprint that he made a promise to himself. To facilitate cancer care
            in whichever way possible.Poor people should not meet the tragic
            fate of his mother! So, he wanted to start a Charity Trust to
            provide shelter and food for the poor patients who undergo treatment
            at Adayar Cancer Institute. He sought the blessings of Shri.
            Jayendra Swamikal who not only blessed him but also prayed that Lord
            Balaji gives him the strength to start the mission. He also
            suggested the name Sri Matha Trust. Being a devotee of Shri Jayendra
            Swamikal, Mr. Krishnamoorthy embraced the name and immediately
            started the Trust. In 2000, the Cancer Institute entered an MoU with
            Sree Kanchi Kamakoti Preetam and Sri Matha Trust to entrust full
            responsibility towards running the free Dharmashala. With the
            support of large-hearted philanthropists, Mr. V. Krishnamoorthy
            started his Trust operations from Dhrmashala Building owned by a
            Rajasthani Trust at Adayar. A few years ago, he moved to a building
            closer to Adyar Cancer Institute and has been successfully running
            the Trust with utmost integrity, sincerity and dedication.
